The men are squatting, huddled close to one other.

A few of them keep their arms stretched out in front of them, while the others hold on tightly to a fighting cock with their fists.

They stare openly at your passing car, unrelenting in their surveillance.

Body language is one of the less well-known – thought most obvious – aspects of cultural encounters.

In so many instances are the body language of a Westerner and that of Balinese distinct mirror images of each other.

While the Caucasian tends to keep his body “open” and receptive, even while sitting, the Balinese keeps his “closed”, his posture tending toward a fetal position, such as in squatting or sitting in the lotus position.

This ensures better familiarity with the body and better control.

Compared to the elegant Balinese gait, with its slow, ﬂowing limbs, Westerners look awkward and ill coordinated.

If not inbred, the physical ease with which the Balinese comport themselves is supported by a close relationship with nature that starts at a very tender age.

In Balinese backyards, young children frolic freely without clothes on, playing with anything they can close their small fists around: be it earth, wood or kitchen implements.

Growing up amidst the ﬂora and fauna and knowing the feel and scent of matter, creating offerings or statues out of these materials comes naturally in adulthood.

Most fascinating is the way the Balinese relate bodily to each other in a social situation.

They tend to huddle close, touching each other lightly on the arm, or at least keeping within “breathing distance” of one another.

This is very different indeed from the Westerners, who tend to keep each other “at bay,” even when they shake hands or give each other a tap on the shoulder.

The examples of this distinction are too numerous to be given here; but the most obvious is in the young Balinese men crowding the _bale bengong_ (roadside shelters), where they rest in the crook of one another’s arms for hours on end.

You may have also noticed the handholding between people who walk together through the village, even people of the same sex, or a light hand on the shoulder.

But the foreigner will not see the cuddling and hugging between brothers and sisters in the big family bed at night.

To the outsider, the key to understanding the collective physical behaviour of the Balinese is to attend a ceremony or temple festival.

You can see whole crowds moving as one, making bodily contact calmly, their movements and behaviour free of any hostility.

On a deeper level, this kind of touching actually creates an inner calm that dissipates tension – as the power of touch has been known to do.

There is never any need for crowd control at an event, no matter how crowded it may become.

The Balinese crowd controls itself, with everyone in close physical symbiosis with everyone else.

Even in “violent” rituals, such as trances and cockfights, this harmony is still apparent.

Evens so, the Balinese do have their moments of physical distance.

But again, this is shown in peculiar ways.

In Bali, eating is not a social event like it is to the Westerner; it is private, a bodily function, and an impure moment.

When he eats, the Balinese tends to isolate himself, either by going to a place where he is alone - the kitchen - or by “closing” himself and his body off from the surrounding environment; particularly during ritual meals.

Although he is an inherently social being, the Balinese is very reluctant to talk while he eats.

Therefore he eats fast, unlike the Frenchman, who seems to talk only when he eats.

These subtleties show a very different perspective of the Balinese and the Westerner in their very different patterns of social intercourse.

The Westerner sees himself as “unique,” separate both from nature and from others.

To him, other people are basically “intruders” in a physical sense, encroaching on his resources and opportunities.

They are like his contenders.

He communicates to a.rm and emphasise his “difference” and “uniqueness”.

Though he does seek companionship, he categorises individuals by those who are “equals” and those who are not.

Hence the dual myth of absolute friendship and love.

The Balinese sees himself the other way.

Instead of being separate, he is a part of nature and part of a collective body of “others.”

To him, the others are basically “the same” as himself.

He feels no need to emphasise his individual identity; he would rather blend within a group.

Being together and touching and hugging is the essence of genuine “communication”.

It is how friendship and love is born. Speech, and in particular, opinionated speech, is secondary to body language.

These differences between the Balinese and Westerners often lead indeed to cultural misunderstanding.

Most Westerners, who are not able to “sense” the intense physical communication, tire quickly of Balinese socialising.

Similarly, the Balinese wonder what these people are doing, talking all the time, as if arguing. But these misunderstandings are benign.

Westerners often misinterpret the Balinese tendency for touching and hugging as having a sexual undertone.

Being so unassuming of physical contact, the Balinese often become prey to those Westerners who touch and hug with intent.

Anyhow, no cultural encounter is without surprises.
