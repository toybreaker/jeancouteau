I had often seen the old man. Dressed in white, his head swathed in the white cloth of the _Pemangku_ priest, limping slightly and his face full of wrinkles, he had a majesty that came with age. He would always smile at me when I drove past him.

Me, the stranger from the riverside, the friend of the _Gamang_ spirits and neighbor of the long-haired ghost from the river garden shrine.

I had apparently become part of his environment and had become the object of some of his questioning.

As for me, having heard of his reputation as the village sage, I had visited him two years ago to inquire about the meaning of some magic ‘_Rerajahan_’ writing I was then studying.

To me, he was the temple priest from the ‘pura desa’, and to him I was a guest from beyond the Java strait, from beyond the realm of his questioning, too. We knew and appreciated each other through our differences.

It was a great surprise then, when I saw him again the other day – and on my doorstep no less – supported by a couple of village youths.

The old limping man had already descended the long stairs to my riverside house.

He wanted to talk to me. And I, of course, in my surprise, wanted to hear what he wished to tell me. He sat and talked, and I listened.

>“Pak Kadek,”

he started slowly, using my Balinese name.

>“I come to see you, the last of my many visits, with the hope that you can answer my quest. I have visited many temples in Bali, prayed in front of their most potent shrines, but to no avail. I have felt the god’s presence, but I am still here, on the same quest. I have been to Banyuwangi, I have called on the most famous _dukun_ magicians in the area. I have read with them the Arabic stanza, and I even put in my room the sign of their faith. But to no avail. I have failed until today to unite my four elder brothers. Can you help me, Pak Kadek?”

He was looking at me sullenly, imploringly, albeit with a light of hope in his eyes.

I was stunned; I did not understand what he meant.

Not knowing what to do, I attempted a smile and invited him to drink some coffee. He continued:

>“I know you can read _lontar_ in the old script, Pak Kadek. Maybe you can help me find the formulas. I want to unite my four brothers.”

Perhaps moving, doing something, opening a book, would help.

I got up, went to my library and after some fumbling, came back with a Balinese book filled with magical formulas.

He opened the book, gave it a cursory glance and cast it aside.

>“I know these formulas. They are of no help to me.”

He carried on:

>“You see, Pak Kadek, I often have the same dream at night. I am on the beach, and a sailing boat comes ashore. It is full of people dressed in white. They beckon to me, then they go without a sign, and their white sail soon disappears onto the horizon. I find myself alone, and lonely on the beach. So help me, Pak Kadek, to unite my four elder brothers.”

It suddenly dawned on me what he really meant: the old wrinkled _mangku_ wanted to die.

The four elder brothers were not simply his siblings, nor were they the four elements of the afterbirth: the amniotic ﬂuid, the placenta, the blood and the vernix caseosa.

They correspond also to the four cosmic seers and the gods of the four directions, in other words the instruments cum symbols of Man’s interrelation with his macrocosmic equivalent.

By admitting his desire to “unite his four elder brothers”, the old _mangku_ priest was telling me of his desire to die, to rejoin his generation’s peers and unite with those from beyond the great sea: the souls of the ancestors, those who visited him in his dreams with their white sailing boats.

The most surprising thing to me was that the old man, a learned temple priest, wanted me, the white stranger from the riverside, the one un-scared of the river spirits, to find him the key to his death and ultimate release.

I couldn’t say a word. I muttered that I would look in my books, that perhaps I had some other mantra formula, and I would certainly, I was sure, find something and bring it to him, so he could unite his ‘four brothers’.

He stood up, hunched over, with the same stiff smile on his mouth. The two youths took him under the armpits, and he went away, limping, without his four brothers.

I slumped back in my seat, overwhelmed. Where and who are you, my four elder brothers, that I may know you and unite you? I burst into tears.

Now, each time I see the white-capped head of a priest on the street, I think of the white sailing boat, of the ‘four elder brothers’ and of you, Pak Mangku, my brother.


_**Note**:_

_the “Four Elder brothers” or “Catur Sanak” portray Man as a microcosm to the Universe, which is the Macrocosm. The four elder brothers are the elements of the afterbirth and consist of the ‘yeh nom’ or amniotic fluid, the ‘ari-ari’ or placenta, the _‘getih’_ or blood, and the _‘banah'_ (lamas) or vernix caeova. These afterbirth/elder brothers are subjected to an afterbirth ceremony and buried. Then, at various times in life they are consulted and presented offerings. They correspond to the gods (Mahadewa, Iswara, Wisnu and Brahma), directions of the compass, weapons, _leyaks_, holy seers, parts of the body etc. They establish the correspondence between the human microcosm and the macrocosm._
