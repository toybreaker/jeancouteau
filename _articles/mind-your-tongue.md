Sexuality is a very sensitive topic in Indonesia, but open to so many contradictions.

At the same time as someone from the People’s Representative Council was downloading hardcore pornography on their iPad caught in the act by a photographer they were able to pass a strict anti-pornography bill.

In spite, or because of such hypocrisy, in the official register of Indonesia, there is very little room for anything outwardly sexual, and blunt sexual speech is out of the question.

Whenever the topic is raised, it is not only with embarrassment, but also with the tendency to attribute anything overly sexual to tourism and other foreign influences, the issue is often seen as foreign influences being negative, unless properly filtered by someone local of course.

Anyway, whatever officialdom thinks, and the law says, there is a lot of sexual speech going on in Bali.

This has caused this writer to blush more than once, while his Balinese friends laugh away.

Not only are the street people regularly descriptive, but also very imaginative.

It is interesting, for example, to see how well garage jargon has been filtered , if you like, by the local culture, to produce a highly modern depiction of a sexual act, often in relation to the motorbike.

Thus, one does not make love, but one changes one’s engine oil” (_ganti oli_) or “one leans the bike on its stand” (_pasang dongkrak_). If the bike doesn t start, it means that your ampere meter does not work properly (_ampere sing majalan_), clearly a metaphor for someone s manhood not functioning.

These few examples bear witness to the role that the engine in general, and more specifically the bike, plays part not only in Balinese transportation, but also in Balinese banter!

Traditionally, the Balinese use of language is very blunt, direct and true, because of this the Balinese are made aware of sexual differences at a very young age. It starts very early in life with the habit of nicknaming the baby, before any “official” name has been given to it.

Thus the boys were called and still are in some places _I Butuh_ or _I Kocong_ (testicles) while the girls were called Ni Lueng, Ni Kembung, names referring to female parts.

Those nicknames, directed at the general nudity of Balinese babies, even result in new names for the parents: _Men Butuh_ (Testicles’ Mother) or _Nang Lecir_ (the Erected One’s father).

For some reason, the contemporary Balinese won t dare use these names in the city, especially when riding a bike!!

So, if the Balinese symbolise modern sexuality as an engine, with its vulgar phrasing, then maybe we could compare the agrarian tradition with fertility.

This awareness of sexuality is deeply rooted, through symbolism, in the mentalities of old.

As in other agrarian societies, Earth is the _Mother Goddess, Pertiwi_, provider of food and symbol of fertility.

Its complementary opposite, with which it comes into union, is the Sky, _Father Akasa_, the symbol of the fertilizing elements.

This belief sometimes led to pseudo magic religious manipulations.

The Balinese peasants who intended to plant vegetables used to stick a stump of wood into the earth to fertilize it, thus maintaining the unity of the cosmic sexual poles.

Men and women often took this symbolism quite literally and hoped to use it for their own, more unorthodox purposes.

In some villages, until quite recently, it was common practice for unmarried women to lie on their back and implore _Father Akasa_ to bestow upon them a mate, as it was for men to lie on their belly and address _Mother Pertiwi_, as if there were some kind of union between men and women wand their cosmic partners.

Those social symbols and behaviors have a long story behind them.

Archeologists have discovered in Bali sarcophagi in the shape of women in the coital position.

On the famous nekara bronze drum of Pejeng, one finds the etching of a frog with a similar female symbolism.

And everywhere there are phallic menhirs and stones dating back to the megalithic pre Hindu times, usually set side by side with an object a split stone for instance that symbolizes the female component.

Many of these objects have been integrated within the paraphernalia of Balinese temples as part of local cults of fertility.

They are worshipped in relation to agricultural events or when a patient is beseeching forgiveness or healing from “the world beyond”.

The sexual connotation of these objects is usually made very obvious.

The village of Kayu Putih, for example, has a “deity” shaped like a 25cm penis and is very bluntly called by the name “_Dewa Celak Gede_, being the Balinese expletive for the male sexual organ.

Worth noticing is that this tradition has not been eradicated by Balinese Hinduism, but integrated as part of its symbolic corpus.

Shivaite Hinduism, as practiced in Bali since the end of the first millennium, also uses phallic and vaginal symbols.

_Pertiwi_ and _Akasa_, as explained earlier, are names of Hindu gods indeed, even though the cult of the earth and sky certainly predates their naming by Sanskrit names.

But Shivaism, although it broadly uses sexual symbols: the lingam and the yoni, the sea and the mountain, sets them in the midst of highly sophisticated cosmology and philosophy.

The world, according to Shivaism, stems from the union of the _Purusa_ (the shivaite lingam) and of the _Pradana_ (the yoni).

Symbols of spirit and matter, of male and female, of the necessary union of cosmic opposites (_Rwabhinneda_) that generates the movement of cosmic Unity.

Sexuality, in Bali, and elsewhere, thus goes well beyond sex, a fact that the nations representatives should be keen to pay attention to.

If need be, by discarding the content of their iPads.
