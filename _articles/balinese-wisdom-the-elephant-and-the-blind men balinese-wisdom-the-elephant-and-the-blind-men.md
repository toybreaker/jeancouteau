Once upon a time - or so goes the story of wise Balinese - in the old country of _Jambu Dwipa_ there lived a group of blind men.

Although they could not see, they had come to know life and the world through their sense of touch and by conversing with one another.

They could walk and talk perfectly well and divine their surroundings through smell, touch and taste, they thought; so they believed they knew all there was to know about the world.

One day, one of them received the following news: a creature had been discovered that was as big as a house and could lift burdens of untold weight.

It was called an “elephant”. It was a beast of wonder, people said. Everyone wanted to see it.

Each man touched a different part of the elephant. the first one touched the trunk, but he thought it was a water jug. the second man touched the ear, which he thought was a fan.

Despite being unable to see, the blind men were much intrigued by this news.

Surely through the power of touch, which they had used to get by their whole lives, they could guess what the elephant was like, nevermind not being able to see it.

Having made up their minds, they asked to be taken to the elephant.

They were conﬁdent they would be able to identify it. So to the elephant they went, escorted by a helpful friend.

When they reached the place where the beast was sleeping, they did not know what to do, so they went up to touch it.

Each man touched a different part of the elephant.

The ﬁrst one touched the trunk, but he thought it was a water jug. The second man touched the ear, which he thought was a fan.

The others fared the same way: one mistook the tusk for a curved trunk, another the belly for a mound of earth.

In other words, each man had touched a different part of the elephant and had come away with the wrong idea.

Each one having only touched one part of the elephant, how could they know, through touch alone, the great beast as a whole?

They could not, because they were blind.

This classical Hindu-Bhuddist story of the blind men teaches an important lesson.

Man cannot “see” beyond the range of his physical perception nor understand beyond the scope of his intelligence.

His knowledge of the “truth” is as much beyond his comprehension as much as the elephant was beyond the perception of the blind men.

The truth can never be grasped and understood fully.

Whatever knowledge we have is Truth that has been misconstrued or distorted.

Knowledge is unknowable.

This skepticism illustrates what can be called a “theology of the relative”, as opposed to the “theology of the absolute” found in Mediterranean religious traditions.

To the Balinese, what matters is not ﬁnding Truth itself, which is always “unknowable”, but the endeavor of man – and hence, of religion – in the direction of Truth.

It is one’s deeds, one’s _karma_ (actions), which determine one’s future in the transmigration of the soul.

In other words, ethics matter more than theological credo. Relativity pervades everything.

The Balinese say that religion must evolve according to three principles: _desa_, which is the place; _kala_, the time and _patra_, the circumstances.

No one faith is completely “correct”, so we should not try to convert other people to our religious views.

Why should we feel the need to do so, when the oneness of religion lies in the diversity of its manifestations?

Religion, the Balinese sometimes say, is like a river: one source that divides into many tributaries, all of which eventually ﬂow into the same river.

The concept of God follows a similar mold.

All attempts at encompassing Truth, and, thus, God, within a rigid set of principles are as illusory as it is for the blind men to “know” the elephant as a whole.

What we know of the “godly” is only its manifestations, and there are as many of them as there are aspects to tangible (_**Sekala**_) and intangible (_**Niskala**_) reality. God pervades everything.

He changes names all the time according to the principle of incarnation.

Some say he dwells in temples (_melinggih_) others say he is much closer to our hearts.

The gods, thus, are one God.

Instead of reducing inﬁnite reality to an absolute Oneness, as in Mediterranean traditions, the Hindu-Balinese acknowledge the Oneness of reality as an inﬁnite number of gods.

Ultimately it is the same. Pantheism is monotheism’s other side of the coin.

The Balinese lesson is ultimately one of tolerance.
