_**When talking about Balinese culture, one usually underlines its agrarian traditions, and particularly its rice-growing tradition. Rice is indeed perpetually present in the landscape and in the rituals: everyone has seen the small sanggah cucuk shrines of Balinese rice fields and the cili effigies of the goddess of rice Sri, who is worshipped in the shrines of any family temple.**_

But rice and rice cults are but one side of the coin. The expansion of rice-growing areas was possible only at the expense of the shrinking of the forest.

We must keep in mind that the Balinese population has increased between four and ﬁve times since the beginning of the 19th  century.

But the process had started much earlier.

From the ninth century on, the kings granted sima (property) rights – often to religious communities and with speciﬁc privileges – for clearing forests and turning them into rice ﬁelds.

It has thus been a centuries-long process, with irrigated areas expanding apace with population growth and with the incremental improvements in irrigation techniques.

Throughout much of history, the communities of forest clearers were physically isolated in the midst of the hostile and lush environment of the woods.

When they grew and overextended their irrigation capacities, some of their members would move elsewhere and start the process anew.

Thus, little by little, forest clearings rejoined other forest clearings, creating the broad expanses of rice ﬁelds that we know today.

Even today, the phenomenon of the forest clearing is still under way in some parts of the island, especially in Bangli and Tabanan.

Most of this recent cutting and slashing, though, is for gardening and plantation purposes and no more for rice growing, as the new areas are usually beyond the range  of irrigation.

The continuation of this old tradition is a threat to the remaining forests - now mostly the property of the state - and to the whole ecological balance of the island.

In spite of its decreasing ecological role, the forest has remained present in many aspects of the Balinese culture.

The literature is full of references to hermits and teachers retiring in the mountain forest.

There is even a speciﬁc text – albeit in Old-Javanese – called the _Kakawin Siwaratrikalpa_ that tells of a hunter living in and from the forest with his family.

The clearing of the forest itself, together with the establishment of rice ﬁelds, which was still common not so
long ago in Bali, is also well documented - although indirectly - by the chronicles kept by most of Balinese kinship groups.

Its legacy is also physically preserved in the various caution temples of origin of the clans or sub-clans.

By visiting these temples at the time of the odalan, the members of the congregation move backward from the latest clearing of the forest - where they live - to the earliest - where they originate.

The activity of their gods parallels this movement of the faithful throughout the territory.

The gods or _Batara_, ancestral deities of different villages, are said to be related to each other as brothers, sisters, or spouses (and even lovers).

As such, they visit each other during the temple festivals, complete with offerings and processions.

In many cases, these religious visits are the symbolic reminder and strengthening of ancient bonds between the village where an initial clearing of the forest took place and its various split-offs.

The resilience of the role of the forest in the Balinese psyche is attested in one of the most original characters of the Balinese pantheon, the _Barong_, who is often depicted as going places and purifying the territory as a local sesuhunan god.

The Barong - whose iconography is obviously of Chinese origins - is also called _'Banaspati Raja'_ or the 'Lord of the forest' and it is said to rule over the woods and its various
inhabitants, such as the gamangs and tonyas.

In spite of its rather frightening face, the Barong assumes a positive and protective role and is depicted in Balinese drama as an antagonist of the ugly witch Rangda, who assumes the negative function.

The masks of both characters are made from a swath of wood cut “alive” from the trunk of a powerful tree such as the kepuh, jepun or pule.

They are then carved through various ritualistic steps into their _Rangda_ or _Barong_ shape, followed by an empowering or pasupati ceremony.

Interestingly, during the ceremonies when _Rangda_ intervenes,
she is usually activated (ngereh) and eventually sent back to her godly abode with all her disciples – spirits, jinn and the like – through the intermediary of a papaya tree.

Thus, we can interpret the two characters of _Barong_ and _Rangda_ as the two opposite aspects of nature (i.e. _Barong_ as the protective power of nature, and Rangda as its threatening aspect).

The centuries-long ﬁght of the Balinese man against the forest to turn it into the civilised world of the palaces and rice ﬁelds is thus conveyed in the unending ﬁght between Barong and Rangda, where cosmology rejoins ecology.

But the forest is also present in another emblematic element of Balinese culture: the theater, especially the _wayang_ (shadow puppet) theater.

Most Balinese drama and wayang performances take place in the mythological past, set in various kingdoms separated from one another by vast expanses of forest.

The trip that the characters make from one kingdom to the other is always full of dangers.

These are often physical, but may also be of a different, and more magical and symbolic nature.

In Balinese drama the forest is the abode of various types of spirits and monsters who have to be subdued or killed.

It is the place of the wilderness, as opposed to the palaces and the rice ﬁelds – the discontinuities of the forest which represent the more peaceful haven of human culture.

The dangers of the forest and wilderness are well known in the _Ramayana_, with the heroin _Sita_ being kidnapped in the _Kandaka_ forest.

Interestingly, it is with the help of the forest’s inhabitants, the monkeys, that she is freed from _Rawana_’s captivity.

There is also an interesting episode of the _Mahabharata wayang_ cycle, which depicts the opening of the kingdom of _Amerta__ and the expelling of its “invisible” owners by the _Pandawa_ brothers.

The forest, the place and symbol of all dangers, is also, for this very reason, the place where one attains wisdom.

The dangers it represents are also the dangers from within the self, which have to be overcome.

The heroes of the Wayang thus go to meditate in the midst of the forest, like _Arjuna_ in the _Kakawin Arjuna Wiwaha_.

Once he has acquired the ability to cultivate peace of mind in the middle of the wilderness, _Arjuna_ is able to overcome all worldly temptations and is therefore rewarded with a weapon of victory.

To subdue one’s fear of the wilderness is equated with the overcoming of one’s desires.

Subjugating the forces of nature within the self is similar to subjugating the forest and opening it to civilization.

Today, alas, the forest is present at the level of myths and culture only.

Except in the Western part of the island and a few mountainous areas, forests are disappearing from the natural Balinese environment.
