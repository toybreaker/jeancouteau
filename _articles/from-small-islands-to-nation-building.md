_**Imagine two small islands of little importance, somewhere in the middle of the 17th century. One of them is located in the cold western lands, at the mouth of a large estuary.**_

_**Its people are religious dreamers; leftovers from a revolution that had their ancestors, a few generations ago, think that they could make a personal reading of the holy Christian scriptures. They view themselves as God’s chosen few.**_

As neighbours they have a few savages and, in the far away distance, small communities of other God’s chosen people.

They speak Dutch, while their neighbours, equally in search of the chosen land, speak English.

Both groups are poor, equally far from and neglected by their respective motherland, but also equally hardworking on the land.

They heard that their countries are at war, but they are reluctant enemies, since what they both hate the most are the “papists”, the pope supporters, whose Spanish galleons still mount daring expeditions against the God’s chosen in the South.

On the other side of the earth, in the East, the other island, smaller, is a hotbed of fevers that attracts, instead of thrifty peasants, merchant ships and reckless adventurers.

There, the Dutch and English, having gotten rid of Spaniards and Papists, are now at each other’s throat, slaughtering one another in more brutal way than when dealing with local savages, Moslem potentates and even hated “papists”.

What they hunt for are riches, as the wild mercenaries of the far away London and Amsterdam’s merchants, and what they are after is the world’s most valuable commodity, more valuable than even gold: nutmeg.

A commodity one single cargo of which guarantees a lasting wealth to its lucky ship-owner. Indeed, a commodity for which even the “chosen ones” forget God and kill.

To Britain and Holland, the second island is more valuable indeed than the first one.

Holland, still the great sea power of the days, controls the routes to the East: The Cape, Cochin, Malacca and Batavia, while Britain competes with the French and Spaniards for the control of the Caribbean islands, where the next commodity of value, sugar, has found a fertile ground.

The British have more people in the vicinity of the cold island, whereas the Dutch have more ships and adventurers in the vicinity of the second one.

So, after much blood and tears, both sides eventually relent and decide to make peace.

The Dutch merchants exult: they have won, or so they think. They retain ownership over the islands of their riches.

They will have full control over the spice trade. In exchange they just have to hand over to the British the cold estuary island and its God’s seeking settlers.

But the Dutch won only on the short term. The settlers, British and Dutch alike, now united under the British crown, brought other settlers, who little by little moved ever further inland.

From a few tens of thousand, they were soon hundreds of thousands, and then a couple of million.

Their descendants are now 300 hundred millions, because the small island the Dutch so foolishly gave up was Manhattan - now the heart of the modern Babel.

Yet, before America knew its hour of glory - now, Holland had its own.

The small island the Dutch fought so wildly to retain was Run, now a forgotten islet in the Moluccan archipelago, in the Eastern part of modern Indonesia.

But from Run in the East and Batavia (now Jakarta) in the West, they bit by bit, through trade, tricks and war, wove a web of economic and human exchanges that, by the middle of the 18th century, turned the Indonesian archipelago into a single economic space.

While doing so, they invented modern colonialism.

But unlike the British in the West, their purpose was not to bring in settlers. It was to trade.

They were merchants, and it was a company, not their government, that governed the “natives” who came under their yoke.

They were in the Indies to exploit the “natives”, while the settlers were in the American colonies to expel and replace them, so that they could freely address their prayers to the only God they knew.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the few tens of thousands of settlers on American land had become a powerful country, strong enough to expel the European powers from its vicinity.

After the defeat of Spain (1898), its land empire was quickly becoming a continental and, fifty years later, a global empire. The settlers had won.

In the East, meanwhile, eager to continue exploiting the riches of what was becoming a “colonial” country, the Dutch started training locals to modern methods of management and technology.

By doing so, however, they brought the “natives” together.

People from Sumatra, Java and the Eastern islands discovered, on the banks of the schools springing up all over the archipelago, that they shared a land, a culture, and even a language and a memory.

They spoke Malay and grew proud of the ancient kingdoms (Sriwijaya, Majapahit etc.) historians were now unearthing from the past.

Almost unwittingly, they were becoming “Indonesians”.
Then, around a century ago, from the French, Chinese and Russian revolutions, the words of “liberty”, justice and freedom started coming to their ear.

They discovered, and then decided they were Indonesians. Bahasa Indonesia would be their language (1928).

And they would get rid of the Dutch, whether the latter liked it or not.

The rest is mythicised, but nevertheless real history.

There were adventurous revolutionaries, like _Tan Malaka_; there were fiery orators like Sukarno and rational thinkers like _Hatta_; there were also nurses and teachers, peasants and peddlers, ordinary people. All first dreamed, then wanted, and finally got independence.


They got it in blood, just after going through the country’s darkest hour: Japanese occupation.

They proclaimed independence on August 17th 1945, two days after Japan’s unconditional capitulation.

A long war ensued, now and then interrupted by UN-sponsored ceasefire until the Dutch eventually recognised that their spice war victory at Run was just an accident of history. Late 1949, they recognised Indonesian independence.

But what would have happened if they had retained control over Manhattan, or if the British had prevailed in Run?

The fact is that the United States, heir to the middle-17th century pockets of settlers, is now the world’s number one power.

While Indonesia, heir to the Dutch’s wily adventurers, which had no more than 7 or 8 million people on its archipelagic surface, is now the world’s fourth most populous country.

Is it an accident if both countries have a very similar motto: _Pluribus Unum in the States_ - One out of _Manya_; _Bhinneka Tunggal Ika_ in Indonesia, Different but One.

Even though countries are born and die from the wind of history, let us celebrate the independence of this one country: Indonesia. _Selamat HUT Kemerdekaan ke-67_.
