_**The atmosphere was not a happy one in Pan Koncrong’s house. His daughter was lying in bed, feverish. An old medicine man (_balian_) had come and muttered a few magical words. But now he was gone, and neither his prayers to the gods of the mountain nor his potions were working. The child was lying helpless on the couch.**_

In panic, Men Koncrong took hold of her husband’s arm, and, stiffening herself an instant, she blurted out:

>"Oh, Jero Gede, Yen pianak tiange seger, titian gme sesaudan lakar ngotonin turngupah wayang."

Oh Jero Gede (_tutelary deity_) if my child is saved, I promise to make her a proper _otonon_ (anniversary) and to present you with a _wayang_ performance.

Then, they waited, and waited. The night came. By early morning, early signs of improvement were there; the baby opened its eyes.

After two weeks it was again crawling on the ground of the large family’s _bale_ (pavilion).

Jero Gede had bestowed health to the sick child. He had been promised a _wayang_ (puppet show) performance and would be waiting for it.


Pan Koncrong and Men Koncrong soon forgot about their vow, (_sot or sauh, slip_) indeed, and the little girl grew normally, although she was never quite healthy.

Then the mother fell ill, and in just a few days, died of a bad case of diarrhea.

She soon became water (_meragayeh_), as people say, meaning that she was one of the origins of the holy water and she belonged there, a deified ancestor in the realm of the invisible world (niskala).

Meanwhile, in the realm of the visible world (_sekala_), her daughter, Ni Luh Koncrong, grew into an attractive girl.

She was sick often, though, which worried her father.

He decided, thus, to consult the gods (_nunasbaos_) through a famous medium (balianmepeluasan), who lived somewhere east of _Abian Gombal_.

Tape recorder in hand, Koncrong, his new wife in tow he had remarried in between took his turn in the crowded line, and when his time came, sat as he ought to sit, presented his offering and waited.

 By then the middle aged _balian_, was by then shaking, and he talked, or rather, she talked, as it was the talk of the dead mother

 >"Kenecening, dugas meme nu hidup taen mesesangi, yen nyak ceningra hayu, meme lakar ngoton inturngupah wayang. Sakewala sing katutuganbaan meme sawirehenggalang meme mati."

Which translates:

>“Oh my daughter, when I was still alive and you were sick, I promised that, if you survived, I would offer you an _otonan_ (anniversary ritual) and present a _wayang_ performance to Jero Gede.""

The medium stopped shaking. It was finished.

Back home, the family gathered, around the tape. There was no doubt Men Koncrong's voice. She was asking for her vow to be kept (_naursot_ _).

A big _otonan_ ceremony should be held, and a _wayang_ show performed. Only then would things be back in order. Some time later.

The day had finally come when Pan Koncrong and Ni Luh Koncrong would fulfil the vow, and the atmosphere was a festive one in the family compound.

The youth of the neighbourhood had all come and they were now playing _ceki_ cards on a nearby wooden platform while getting drunk on arak palm alcohol.

The women, meanwhile, were busying themselves with the preparation of offerings.

The priest of the village temple (_mangkuadat_) and the priest of the kinship temple (_mangkupanti_), had both been requested to lead the ceremony, and one could recognise them by their white cloth and headdress among the assembled family.

Men Koncrong had been cremated a long time now and she had become a deified ancestor in the form of water (meragayeh), as the tradition puts it.

She nevertheless had to be kept informed of the proceedings and made to witness them (_mesaksi_). So the day before the ceremony proper, Pan Koncrong and his daughter, accompanied by a priest and family members had been to the cemetery and presented an offering to her soul and to the Lord of the dead.

Men Koncrong would thus attend the _otonan_ (anniversary) of her daughter and witness the fulfilment of her vow.

five chickens had also been slaughtered and would be offered to the _Kanda Empat_, the so called Little Brothers, who are born along with a newly born child in the shape of the after birth , and who protect the child throughout the phases of life as its cosmic guardians.

Then the family members were sitting in front of the offerings, Pan Koncrong and Luh Kerti in the first row, facing the “North (Kaja), and the village temple priest requested silence.

He held between his fingers long slices of coconut leaves on which one could see a long line of Balinese characters.

He read it, thus announcing the payment of the promise (_naursot_), or in other words, the fulfilment of the vow, which would appease the dead and, thus, guarantee the living a more stable and happier life.

He then asked whether the family was ready to welcome” the soul of the dead. In other words, he proposed a trance”.

Quickly, perhaps wary of the unforeseen consequences, Pan Koncrong repelled the offer, and thus, Men's Koncrong's soul remained in her invisible _Niskala_ abode. Then everyone was presented with holy water.

A _wayang kulit_ performance had also been promised, and, with the approach of the night, the _dalang_ came, a young man from Banjar. As befits a _wayang_ performance from Northern Bali, everything was quick, fun, and dynamic.

The show lasted barely two hours, and everyone laughed at the comic characters of _Twalen_ and _Sangut_, who, unlike in the South, are attributed by a moving jaw.

Contrary to what might be expected, the _wayang_ show s story itself did not bear any relation to the paying of a promise or the condition in the world of the dead souls.

It was just a regular love story, with the young male hero tricked by a giant and his pretty daughter.

Nevertheless, the show was part of a ritual.

The puppeteer, called “Master Puppeteer or _Jero Dalang_, didn’t perform only as a showman, but also as a priest.

Upon completion of the performance, a small ceremony was held, which produced a holy water called _Tirta Wayang_, which was sprinkled around to the assembled family.

The following morning, Pan Koncrong, his daughter Luh Kerti and the whole family went one last time to the temple of the dead to send back Men Koncrong's soul to her godly abode.

She had indeed attended the whole ceremony, albeit in her invisible form.
