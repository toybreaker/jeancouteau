_**In the fourth year of independence Darmi was a coffee stall warung keeper known for her charm and beauty. She had a smile for all from behind the counter, between the bottles and shampoos.**_

_**With skin as fair as ivory and eyes as round as the moon, she was by far the prettiest of all the coffee stall keepers of the village of Bukit Simpangan, and youths from all over were lining up at her bench, ordering coffee with the hope of a wink in return.**_

In those times, the bike was not yet what it was bound to become, a courtship instrument, and the village gallants would usually walk to their belles, eager for a talk and waiting for a sign. 

Among Darmi's many gallants, one was particularly ugly. His name was Gencel, who was also rich, daring, and patient.

Above all, he had a bike. Gencel had been wearing out his pants on Darmi's bench for well over two years, and still there was no wink for him.

Darmi had others to smile at.

Gencel tried all the ways of the village gallants. One day, he would act macho, the following day show off his money and flaunt it.

But whatever he did she remained stone faced.

It seemed that the more he tried to charm her, the more she avoided his approaches. He had to find another way.

One day, on the Wednesday of _Parangbakat week_s, it happened that Darmi needed to go to Denpasar to refurbish the stocks of her stall as she did once every three days, when it was market day at Jimbaran.

There was no motor vehicle in her village so she had to walk first to the village of Jimbaran where she would catch a bus to Denpasar and make her purchases.

But when she arrived at the hamlet of _Tegeh Sari_, a bike pulled up next to her.

It was Gencel, with a big smile on his face:

>“Hey, Darmi,"

he called out.

>"Where are you going to so early in the morning? Let me take you to Jimbaran market."

He had always been a regular and polite patron. Why should Darmi repel him? So she accepted, adding:

>"Okay I ride with you until the market of Jimbaran, but don't ride too fast as I am scared."

Having said these words, she soon found herself astride Gencel s saddle.

Gencel was in command now. At last he had his belle for a ride, and he noticed that the faster he pedalled, the tighter she held him, admittedly more out of fright than out of love.

But he did not care. He felt the female grip all down his spine and his heart pounded.

When he arrived at Jimbaran, she thought he would stop, but he did not.

He accelerated instead, so she could not get off.

>“Bli (Brother), won't you stop at the bus station so I can catch my bus?"

she asked timidly from behind his shoulders.

>"Aren't you going to Denpasar,”

He replied while accelerating. He was now riding like mad, unheeding her protest, and was soon crossing Tuban, and, a few minutes later, Kuta.

>"Bli, Bli, why do you ride so fast?”

she asked anxiously while pounding helplessly on Gencel’s broad shoulders.

>"Because I want to talk to you.”

And he rode on, taking the road to Denpasar, bent over his engine, sweat pouring all over his body, partly from the effort, and partly from fear.

On the back, pounding and shrieking, but not daring to jump, there was the pretty Darmi, the ‘village flower of _Bukit Simpangan_', on a helpless ride with the ugly Gencel.

Suddenly, while they were riding across the village of _Abian Gombal_,

Gencel made a turn, which took them into a Balinese courtyard.


He went straight to the _balai daja_ (northern pavilion) and, pulling the shaken Darmi by the arm, he took her inside.

Ten minutes later, unheeding the It was not long, though, before the owner of the house showed up, an old friend of Gencel who had lent him the room for his prowess and her cries.

>"Who is that girl you have brought here, Gencel?"

asked his friend Pan Mimis.

>"She is my girlfriend Darmi,”

he replied.

>”Go to Jimbaran and tell my father to settle the matter with her family.”

Behind him, the girl was sprawled on the bed in shock. Pan Mimis did not know, or did not care to know.

He took the bike and went to Jimbaran. And time thus passed, a time filled with love and violence.

At four p.m. some movement was heard in the courtyard. Gencel s father and mother had come, accompanied by Darmi’s parents and the _banjar_ (neighbourhood) customary officials.

They were arguing loudly: Let me get inside and see if she really loves him or has been eloped by force,”

Darmi’s father was calling out insistently. But Pan Mimis, the owner of the place, would not let him in.

>“You are in my house. I won't prevent you from talking, but I won't allow you to enter into that building of mine. Settle your business from the outside."

Then Darmi’s mother approached the _bale daja_ and blurted out emotionally:

>"Hey, Darmi, I am your mother, tell me if you eloped from your own will or if that Gencel has kidnapped you by force."

Please he had heard the sound of their voices and their arguments, he had taken Darmi by the hair with his left hand, while with his right he had put a knife to her neck. So he told the girl:

>“Darmi, answer your mother. Answer what you want. But know at once, if you tell her you don t love me, both of us will die, right now, today. I'll slit your throat and next take my own life. Darmi could not say a word. She was sweating all over and trembling. Darmi,"

her father was now shouting,

>"Answer you mother. We came here with the _klian_ (headman) so as to settle the matter properly.”

Meanwhile, the blade of Gencel's knife was cold on the neck of the girl, and Gencel was now murmuring in a threatening tone:

>Let s finish it, Darmi. Let's marry or let's die.”

Then, hiding her cries, Darmi spoke:

>“Mother, Father, go back home, I am here with Gencel from my own will. Let me leave you now and make my life with Gencel.”

So they left. When Gencel told me the story, Darmi was a few meters away, busy in the kitchen.

She has five children and twelve grandchildren.

She carries a sad smile on her face.

This was a plegandang marriage, a marriage by kidnapping, still very common 50 years ago.

It has been outlawed, but, according to Jennaway (Sisters and Lovers 2002), remains a form of marriage under the name of _nganten ngejuk_. There is not only paradise in Bali.
