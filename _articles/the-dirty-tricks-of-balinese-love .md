One of the signs of the radical changes happening in Bali is the article I am writing, which is supposed to be about Balinese love.

The Balinese do indeed have love stories, but in their traditions there is no particular day dedicated to love.

So, all the fuss being made about Valentine’s Day is one of the surest signs that the Balinese, having lost control of their economy through huge tourism investments, are now losing touch with their otherworldly or symbolic beliefs.

They have begun to “construct” love. These western traditions are imposed on them from the outside, through modern media.

Probably more young Balinese people know about St. Valentine or Romeo and Juliet than about the love story of Salya, a warrior hero from the Mahabharata and his (of course) beautiful wife Satyawati.

However, there are still quite a few of them who know the kind of stories I am about to tell below.

The best way to enter the topic is probably not to talk about Salya.

This is for a very simple reason; he swore faithfulness to his wife, something which is not so common in Bali.

Men in Bali are not expected to be faithful.

It is good enough for them to be good providers for their spouse and children – this is enough to appease the in-laws.

If they can, they can take a Balinese lover.

And if they cannot, a rich woman, whom, in some cases, can give them a hand, if I dare say.

This is frequently the case with gigolos.

These gigolos, many of whom are surfers, know how to provide their wives with economic resources while doing sexual favours for their Western lover(s).

In some instances, it works, owing to a division of labor, but not for very long.

The Balinese wife is usually much younger than her Western counterpart and whatever gymnastics the latter tries, there comes a time when he tires of her and the ‘incentive’ begins to dissipate.

And without incentives, there is no money. Period. So the husband and wife split.

The Balinese wife gets a new house, and the Western lover is left with new old memories.

Meanwhile, the man is free, because men’s faithfulness is not to be expected.

If his wife is jealous, she is ‘wrong’: she did not make him the children he expected – in particular the male heir who is going to look after his dead soul in the family shrine.

Or, more simply, she did not properly ‘service’ his sexual needs (_sing bisa ngayahin kurenanne_).

No matter what we do, we just never do enough, ladies!

Yet, to view it from the perspective of resources, like above, whether the adultery is for sexual or economic reasons, the set up does have certain logic.

So it is something the women must bear with, albeit with tears and despair.

The fun, or the horror, is when magic becomes a part of the picture.

I know one such interesting story about the eldest son of a close friend of mine.

This young man, let us call him Ketut, was married and, probably for some reason of incompetent ‘servicing’, took a lover.

The girl got pregnant. In other climates, under such circumstances, it is the wife who is going to be upset and hurl insults at her philandering husband, but not necessarily in Bali.

The wife did not do anything like that, but ended being wrong all the same.

Her rival gave birth to a premature child, who died at birth.

‘Normally’, it should have been good riddance between the husband and wife – this would have solved the problem.

But not in this case.

After several visits to a few well-selected mediums, with incense and ‘ancestors’ coming down through the medium’s mouth, it was ‘discovered’ that Ketut’s wife was actually a witch.

She had caused her husband’s newborn child’s death by cutting the umbilical cord.

Beyond that, it was later revealed, she had also caused all the mishaps that had hit the family in recent years.

Of course! It is no surprise, I must say, that Ketut never goes back home anymore: he is the real victim.

Poor boy! As for the wife, having become a leak through the sacrifice of a child – because of course she went to the temple of death (_Pura Dalem_) to perform the right rituals to Durga the destroyer—she is now finished.

She has become a social outcast in her village. But does she deserve it? Ah! Women!

Yet, women are not always the perpetrators when it comes to the use of magic for malice.

At least this is what a good father will say of his 17 year-old daughter, whom he discovered was having an affair with the village rascal.

The father would defend his daughter by saying,

>“If he got my daughter, it could only be because he used magic. He obtained an _Arjuna coin_ or has a magic ring (_bungkung_).”

Of course, I don’t believe it: I don’t recall, in my heydays, having ever used any ring.

Every man knows that if a woman loses her virginity, it is never her fault.

So what does a Balinese father do if he is convinced that his daughter has succumbed to a man’s magic?

He looks for a stronger sorcerer.

He forces his daughter to participate in a ceremony with wafting incense, the bewildered girl sitting on the ground in a state of confusion.

It soon appears obvious, to the officiating _balian_, and most importantly, to the father, that the girl, his daughter, is indeed possessed.

The more the _balian_ calls up his reserve of holy formulas – some of them borrowed from Islam — the more confused the girl becomes.

Then she suddenly quiets down. He gives her a _gegemet_ (a charm with holy syllables), which she usually slips underneath her bra.

She is now safe: no counter-charm, no magic ring can have power over her now.

Her father is relieved: he can now marry his daughter to the cousin he has long dreamed of making his son-in-law.

What conclusions to give to these real-life stories? First, in spite of what I said in my introduction, Valentine’s Day is probably something positive: it announces the autonomy of the person – the woman in particular.

It introduces a new world of reason and true romantic love, which requires both partners to be faithful.

Secondly, those of you who were impressed by ‘Eat Pray Love’ starring Julia Roberts should know that this movie and related book are crap.

They were made to suit a market niche of New Age consumers of eastern wisdom. Reality is more complex and far less ideal.

Last but not least, the main issue is indeed the emancipation of women.

Aggressive feminism won’t do much in the short term, nor will the over-idealisation of Bali: they may well increase the ethnocentrism of Balinese males and thus further isolate Balinese women.

As ever, the problem is indeed with men.
