>“Ketut, I absolutely need your help to go to the Brahmin _gria_ (mansion) and as you know you to are the only one who can help me. You know them well and are close to them”.

Somprong and his friend, Dabdab, were sitting and talking on the single bench of Mrs. Somprong’s tea stall.

They used to sit there and talk everyday of the yellowing of
the rice or of their daily duties to the gods.

They chatted casually amidst the heaps of fruits and jars of cookies, the omnipresent smoke of incense wafting on the air.

This time, Dabdab was making a serious request:

>“I cannot even speak their language --(meaning proper high-Balinese). But for you, Somprong, it will be easy. You are one of their _sisia_ (disciples) aren’t you? Come on.”

The request was becoming a demand.

There was no way Somprong could avoid it, going to the Brahmins.

So without another word, he stood and went to the back of the tea stall and picked up a hanging batik tapestry and a shawl, wrapped them around his waist and came back out, smiling: He was now properly dressed, as one ought to be when visiting the _peguruan_ (teacher’s lodging).

They soon reached the entrance of the gria.

There was no outward mark to differentiate it from the other houses in the village, except the two statues of guardians in front of the entrance and the relief of a swan above the lintel of the gate.

They went in. They had just been inside, between the entrance proper and the small _aling-aling_ separating wall, as Somprong, looking around, suddenly realised he had begun to walk with small, cautious steps and with a bowing gait, and he remembered.

He was back in the old house.

>“Ratu Pedanda (Your Eminence)”;

these were the words his father had used, addressing the high priest.

>”Life has given my wife and I more sons than we can afford. My father and his father before him, as you know, have been the faithful dependants (_braya_) of your holy mansion. This is why I come to you with this young child of mine and entrust him to you, so that he learns from your house all the holy teachings and the good things in life.”

In those times, the _gria_ was still rich, and the request had been welcome.

Somprong had been accepted to live with the Brahmins.

The high priest had entrusted him to one of his brothers, Ida Bagus Alit, who lived in an adjacent house.

He was brought up to be a _sisia_ , or a “student”. Being of low caste, he became also, ipso facto, one of the dependants of the _gria_, meaning that he had to do his share of the daily chores such as washing the clothing of the Brahmins, fetching water or looking after the pigs.

He was fed for his work, although he always took his meal in separate quarters with the other dependants and sometimes from the food and offerings left over from the Brahmins.

Such was his fate, but he was happy with it: the Brahmins were good to him and fulfilled their duties.

Ida Bagus Alit had even registered Somprong at the primary school and he let him attend, at night, the teaching sessions of the _gria_, when all the _sisia_ of the village would come and sit with the Brahmins for the reading of the texts.

This is how Somprong, over time, picked up all the secrets of old Javanese, the language of holy wisdom and literature. He had also gained some initiation into the rituals of the _gria_.

Ida Bagus Alit, an _ulaka_ (not yet ordained) Brahmin would often take him along to assist him in tooth-filing or cremation ceremonies. Last but not least, Somprong was also the pedanda’s (high priest) favorite _sisia_, and he would sometimes accompany the old man on his journeys to bring holy water (_tirta_) to the waiting faithful.


One day, after Somprong had grown into a strong and handsome young man, the old priest had taken him aside and said:

>“ Somprong, you have learned a lot with us. Isn’t it time now that you went back to your father and looked for a wife? When you have found one, come back here and I shall help you. You know that piece of land that the gria owns to the east of the village temple? I shall give it to you. As long as you have children and your sons have children, you can freely occupy that land of ours. But don’t forget your old bonds to us, and whenever there is work to do at the gria you must come to us to help.”

The high priest kept his word.

Somprong married and claimed his piece of land where he lived with his wife and two children.

He was careful never to miss any rituals or neglect his work at at the Brahmins’ mansion.

Because of them, he had become a man of letters.

Being one of the few literate men, at every temple festival he was called for the reading of the stories of old, which lasted well into the depth of the night.

Since entering the Brahmins’ compound, thus, Somprong had been recalling his youth as a Brahmin’s man.

And now, he was back with Dabdab in the same house.

As he was looking around, his eyes caught those of an old lady who was sitting alone, preparing an offeringsering on the pavilion, surrounded by flowers and colourful offerings.

He knew her: she had been a beauty in her heyday, but she had never married.

Now her beauty had waned, and she made a living making offerings for families holding cremations or similar large-scale ceremonies.

She alone knew all the secrets of their form and colours.

It was said that she’d once fallen in love with a man of princely blood. But the Brahmins of those days did not marry the princely _satria_, and the men of her clan had spurned her beauty.


She was busy when Somprong addressed her.

>“_Ratu_ (Your Excellence)”

he said,

>“could _Ratu Pedanda_ (His Eminence the high-priest) receive us for a short visit?”

The High-Balinese words, which would have been awkward coming from the mouth of an ordinary villager, sounded natural when Somprong uttered them.

Somprong’s companion sensed it, too; and he gaped in admiration at the choice of the words, words that are used only when addressing a Brahmin.

>“What do you want from him?”

asked Dayu Raka, adding,

>“I almost did not recognise you, Somprong. Do you come now only when you need us? If you want to see Ratu Pedanda he should be in the _bale dangin_ (eastern pavilion).”

Wrinkled and balding, the old man was indeed in the eastern pavilion, sitting crosslegged and straight-backed among the products of his trade: a few palm-leaf manuscripts and betel set.

Somprong and Dabdab approached and sat silently at his feet.

Then, locking his left hand on his right one in a typical Balinese gesture of respect, Somprong uttered quietly,

>“_Ratu Pedand_a, I come in audience to you with one of your people from the _banjar dangin_ who has a request to make.”

Having spoken these words, he waited. The old man raised his eyes and said:

>“It is you, my good Somprong. But you, who are you?”

He addressed the embarrassed Dabdab.

>“I do not know you yet, it seems?”

>“I am Kaki Ada‘s son,”

answered Dabdab, blushing.

>“I have come to you to beg you to choose a date for the mukur (post cremation) ceremony the people of our clan are holding, and to bless it as well.”

>“Kaki Ada… “

murmured the old priest. His face lit up with recognition.

>”You too are one of my _sisia_ (disciples)! But I have not heard of you for years. And in all those years you have never come here to ask for your holy water. Have you forgotten the _gria_ of your father, your _peguruan_ (the house of the only knowledge)?”

Dabdab had expected the reproach and had prepared a response, but he said nothing.

More than ten years ago his clan had shifted allegiance from the Brahmin’s _gria_ to an _empu_ priest of his lineage.

There had been “signs,” however, such as illnesses and accidents, that the decision was cursed.

A medium had been consulted and the ancestors had “talked”.

The majority of the members of his group had then relented and decided to re-establish the ties of old with the _gria_.

This was what Dabdab had come for.

The old priest turned around, picked up a manuscript and consulted it in silence.

Ten minutes later, he had found a propitious date.

The ceremony would be on a Wednesday, on the _Paing_ day of the five-day week, during the _Uye_ week of the 210-day _Pawukon_ calendar.

Somprong and Dabdab, their job done, withdrew in silence from the _bale dangin_.

They left a _canang_ (flower offering) at the _gria_ temple, then took their leave from the wrinkled Dayu, bowing in respect.

Then they went back to the warung to pick up where they’d left off.
